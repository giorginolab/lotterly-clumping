# On the probability of clumping of lottery serial numbers

In the 2020 extraction of the Italian lottery, there was a 
"clump" of [3 almost-consecutive winning](https://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/01/07/news/lotteria_italia_ferno_varese_premi_biglietti_numeri_vicini-245177811/) serial numbers,
namely P474343, P474346, P474348.  This has raised suspicions.

**Q.** *How likely it is that such a clumping, or a stronger one, 
would arise given the null hypothesis that winning numbers
are independent and uniformly distributed, if extracted without
replacement?*

Let's use a simple Monte-carlo (how apt) simulation to 
answer the question **Q**, which is of course framed as a 
Fisher-style null-hypothesis test.
